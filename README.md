# The Blockchain Scalability Stack: Understanding L1, L2, and Rollups in 2025

In the constantly evolving world of blockchain technology, one challenge has remained persistent since Bitcoin's inception: scalability. As we navigate through 2025, this challenge has become more critical than ever, with blockchain networks struggling to handle increasing transaction volumes while maintaining security and decentralization. The explosion of DeFi applications, NFT marketplaces, and enterprise blockchain adoption has pushed networks to their limits, highlighting the urgent need for scaling solutions.

Think of popular blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum as bustling highways during rush hour—they can only handle so many cars (transactions) at once before traffic slows to a crawl and toll fees (gas prices) skyrocket. This is where the concept of a layered blockchain architecture comes into play, offering promising solutions to this fundamental problem.

In this guide, we'll break down the blockchain scalability stack, exploring the differences and relationships between Layer 1 protocols, Layer 2 solutions, and the innovative technology of rollups. Whether you're a developer looking to understand where to build your next dApp or an investor trying to make sense of the blockchain ecosystem, this article will provide you with the knowledge to navigate the increasingly complex world of blockchain scalability.

## What is Layer 1 (L1)?

### Definition

Layer 1 refers to the base blockchain protocol—the fundamental architecture upon which the entire network operates. This is the foundation of the blockchain ecosystem, handling consensus mechanisms, block production, transaction validation, and security enforcement. When someone mentions Bitcoin or Ethereum, they're typically referring to Layer 1 networks.

Layer 1 blockchains maintain their own independent ledger and security model, often secured by thousands of validators or miners working to maintain the integrity of the network. They are self-contained systems with their own native cryptocurrencies used for transaction fees and, in many cases, network governance.

### Examples

**Bitcoin**: The original blockchain platform, Bitcoin uses a Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism that prioritizes security and decentralization over transaction throughput. As of 2025, Bitcoin's throughput remains around 7 transactions per second (TPS).

**Ethereum**: Following its transition to Proof of Stake (PoS) with the Merge in 2022 and subsequent upgrades, Ethereum has improved its efficiency while maintaining strong security. However, even with the Dencun upgrade of early 2024, Ethereum's base layer still processes only about 15-25 TPS.

**Solana**: Designed with scalability in mind, Solana implements a unique Proof of History (PoH) mechanism alongside PoS to achieve much higher throughput—theoretically up to 65,000 TPS, though real-world performance varies.

**Avalanche**: Using a novel consensus protocol called Snow, Avalanche achieves high throughput and fast finality while maintaining a high degree of decentralization.

### Pros and Cons

**Pros:**
- **Maximum Security**: L1 blockchains typically offer the highest level of security in the ecosystem, with economic incentives designed to make attacks prohibitively expensive.
- **True Decentralization**: Most L1s prioritize decentralization, with thousands of independent nodes validating transactions.
- **Self-Sovereignty**: L1 chains don't rely on other networks for their security or functionality.
- **Settlement Assurance**: Transactions on L1 have the highest level of finality and settlement guarantees.

**Cons:**
- **Limited Scalability**: Most L1s face inherent scalability limitations due to the need for global consensus and state replication across all nodes.
- **High Transaction Costs**: When network demand exceeds capacity, transaction fees can spike dramatically (as Ethereum users experienced during various NFT minting frenzies).
- **Slow Innovation**: Making changes to L1 protocols is intentionally difficult, requiring broad consensus from the community and careful testing.
- **Resource Intensity**: Running full nodes for L1 networks often requires significant computational resources, potentially limiting participation.

## What is Layer 2 (L2)?

### How it Works

Layer 2 refers to a secondary framework or protocol built on top of an existing L1 blockchain. The fundamental purpose of L2 solutions is to handle transactions off the main chain (off-chain) while inheriting the security guarantees of the underlying L1. 

Think of Layer 2 as express lanes built above our congested highway—they redirect traffic to reduce congestion on the main road while still connecting to it at key points. L2 solutions process transactions separately from the main chain, batching them together and then periodically settling these batches on the L1 blockchain.

The core innovation of L2s is that they don't require consensus for every transaction, allowing them to process transactions faster and more cheaply than the base layer while maintaining a strong connection to the underlying blockchain's security model.

### Real-world Examples

**Polygon**: Initially launched as a sidechain for Ethereum, Polygon has evolved into a suite of scaling solutions, including Polygon PoS (a separate proof-of-stake chain), Polygon zkEVM (a ZK-rollup), and other technologies. Polygon's ecosystem has become home to thousands of applications seeking Ethereum compatibility with lower fees and faster transactions.

**Arbitrum**: One of the most successful optimistic rollup solutions on Ethereum, Arbitrum processes transactions off-chain and posts only compressed proofs to Ethereum. Since its launch, it has attracted billions in total value locked (TVL) across hundreds of dApps.

**Optimism**: Another prominent optimistic rollup solution for Ethereum, Optimism uses fraud proofs to ensure security while offering significantly lower fees and higher throughput than the Ethereum base layer.

**Lightning Network**: Built for Bitcoin, the Lightning Network enables near-instant micropayments through payment channels, allowing users to conduct multiple transactions off-chain before settling the final balance on the Bitcoin blockchain.

### Why it Matters for Scaling

Layer 2 solutions are crucial for blockchain scalability for several reasons:

1. **Exponential Throughput Improvement**: L2s can increase transaction throughput by orders of magnitude—from dozens to thousands or even tens of thousands of TPS.

2. **Fee Reduction**: By batching many transactions together, L2s dramatically reduce the per-transaction cost. In 2025, transactions on L2s typically cost 10-100x less than on L1.

3. **Application Viability**: Many use cases that would be economically unfeasible on L1 (like microtransactions or frequent gaming interactions) become possible on L2.

4. **Reduced Energy Consumption**: By minimizing the number of transactions that require full L1 consensus, L2s help reduce the overall energy footprint of blockchain networks.

5. **Specialized Functionality**: Some L2s offer specialized features optimized for specific applications, like gaming, DeFi, or enterprise use cases.

## Understanding Rollups

### Difference between Optimistic and ZK-Rollups

Rollups represent the most prominent category of L2 scaling solutions, particularly for Ethereum. They work by processing transactions off-chain, then posting compressed data or proofs to the L1. There are two main types of rollups, each with distinct security models:

**Optimistic Rollups** (like Arbitrum and Optimism):
- Assume transactions are valid by default (hence "optimistic")
- Rely on a challenge period (typically 7 days) during which validators can submit fraud proofs if they detect invalid transactions
- Compatibility advantages: Can generally run existing Ethereum smart contracts with minimal modifications
- Lower computational requirements than ZK-Rollups
- Longer withdrawal periods due to the challenge window

**Zero-Knowledge Rollups** (ZK-Rollups):
- Use complex cryptographic proofs (validity proofs) to mathematically verify the correctness of all transactions
- No challenge period needed, allowing for faster finality and withdrawals
- Higher computational requirements for generating zero-knowledge proofs
- Historically had more limitations with smart contract compatibility, though this gap has narrowed significantly with advances like zkEVMs

To use an analogy, optimistic rollups are like a banking system that processes all checks immediately but gives a week for problems to be reported, while ZK-rollups are like a banking system that mathematically verifies each check's validity in real-time.

### Use Cases and Platforms Using Each

**Optimistic Rollup Platforms and Use Cases:**
- **Arbitrum**: Home to a wide range of DeFi applications, including derivatives platforms, decentralized exchanges, and lending protocols
- **Optimism**: Popular for DeFi, NFT marketplaces, and social applications
- **Base** (by Coinbase): Focused on mainstream adoption and onboarding to web3, with emphasis on consumer applications
- **Use Cases**: Gaming applications with frequent small transactions, social media dApps, prediction markets

**ZK-Rollup Platforms and Use Cases:**
- **zkSync**: Offers the Era ecosystem with full EVM compatibility through their zkEVM implementation
- **Polygon zkEVM**: Polygon's zero-knowledge scaling solution with Ethereum compatibility
- **StarkNet**: Provides a complete Layer 2 network with its own programming language (Cairo)
- **Use Cases**: Applications requiring immediate finality, high-value transactions, privacy-focused applications, exchanges requiring rapid withdrawals

### How Rollups Integrate with L1 Chains

Rollups maintain a deep integration with their underlying L1 blockchain:

1. **Data Availability**: Rollups post transaction data or compressed proofs on the L1 blockchain, ensuring that anyone can reconstruct the L2 state if needed.

2. **Security Inheritance**: By anchoring their state to the L1, rollups inherit the security properties of the underlying blockchain—if Ethereum is secure, transactions processed on its rollups are secure as well.

3. **Asset Bridging**: Users can move assets between L1 and L2 through bridge contracts, which lock assets on one layer while minting equivalent tokens on the other.

4. **Smart Contract Communication**: Advanced rollups allow smart contracts on L2 to communicate with contracts on L1, enabling complex cross-layer applications.

5. **Dispute Resolution**: For optimistic rollups, the L1 serves as the final arbiter for resolving disputes about transaction validity.

The Dencun upgrade on Ethereum in early 2024 introduced "blob space" through EIP-4844, providing a cheaper way for rollups to post data to the L1, further enhancing this integration and reducing costs.

## Why L2s and Rollups Are the Future of Blockchain

### How They Solve the Trilemma

The blockchain trilemma posits that blockchains must sacrifice one of three key properties: scalability, security, or decentralization. Layer 2 solutions and rollups offer a promising approach to addressing this fundamental challenge:

**Scalability**: By moving transaction processing off-chain, L2s can achieve throughput of thousands of transactions per second, far exceeding L1 capabilities.

**Security**: By inheriting security from the underlying L1 blockchain, well-designed L2s maintain strong security guarantees while improving performance.

**Decentralization**: L2s can maintain decentralization by ensuring that their verification and fraud-proof systems are permissionless and by posting sufficient data to L1 to allow independent verification.

While no solution completely solves the trilemma, the layered approach allows for engineering tradeoffs that optimize for specific use cases while maintaining critical properties.

### Impacts on DeFi, NFTs, and Enterprise Adoption

**DeFi Revolution**: Layer 2 solutions have transformed DeFi by making it accessible to users with smaller portfolios. In 2025, the majority of DeFi volume now occurs on L2s, with only the largest transactions settling directly on L1. Composability between different L2s has created new opportunities for cross-platform yield strategies and liquidity provision.

**NFT Democratization**: The high gas costs of minting and trading NFTs on Ethereum's L1 previously excluded many creators and collectors. L2 solutions have democratized access, leading to an explosion in digital art, gaming assets, and social tokens. The ability to mint thousands of NFTs for pennies has enabled new models for creator economies.

**Enterprise Implementation**: For enterprises, L2 solutions have addressed key concerns about transaction costs and throughput. Major corporations now operate private instances of rollup technology, allowing them to process thousands of transactions internally before settling on public networks. This hybrid approach satisfies both privacy requirements and the need for public verification.

**Gaming On-Chain**: Perhaps most transformatively, L2s have enabled true on-chain gaming experiences that were previously impossible due to cost and latency constraints. Virtual worlds with thousands of simultaneous players interacting with verifiable on-chain assets have become reality.

## Recent Developments (e.g., Ethereum Dencun Upgrade)

The Ethereum Dencun upgrade, implemented in early 2024, marked a significant milestone for rollup technology. The introduction of EIP-4844, also known as "proto-danksharding," created a new transaction type called "blobs" that provide temporary but highly cost-effective data storage specifically designed for rollups.

### What it Means for Rollups and Transaction Costs

**Dramatic Fee Reduction**: Since the upgrade, rollup transaction fees have dropped by approximately 80-90%, making even complex smart contract interactions affordable for everyday users.

**Increased Throughput**: The additional data space has allowed rollups to process more transactions in each batch, increasing overall throughput across the ecosystem.

**Improved User Experience**: Lower fees and faster processing have significantly enhanced user experience, driving adoption of L2 solutions.

**Cross-Rollup Infrastructure**: The reduced cost of data posting has accelerated the development of cross-rollup bridges and interoperability protocols, allowing assets and information to flow more freely across the ecosystem.

**Sequential Upgrades**: The Dencun upgrade represents just one step in Ethereum's roadmap toward "The Surge," which will continue to optimize for rollups with future improvements like full danksharding expected to further reduce costs and increase throughput.

These developments have cemented L2s and rollups as not just a temporary solution but a fundamental part of blockchain architecture going forward, with L1 chains increasingly focusing on providing security and data availability for a diverse ecosystem of specialized L2 solutions.
